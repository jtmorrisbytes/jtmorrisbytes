This is my personal website experiment. I call it my experiment because I set out to prove that I could sucessfully design, document, and implement a personal website.

This website will be a personal documentary of all my projects that I will create in my spare time between work and family. I am working on breaking into the tech sector and hope that I will impress someone somewhere.

#Dev notes!

- node-sass@4.9.4 will not work on ubuntu 64-bit on nodejs versions later than ten, even with the expected runtime installed. use node verisions 10 or earlier
