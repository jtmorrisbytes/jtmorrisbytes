<h1>Here is the draft for the landing page.</h1>
<h2> <a href="http://www.jtmorrisbytes.com/start">jtmorrisbytes.com/start </a></h2>

<h3>here are some ideas for the front landing page:</h3>

- on the landing screen there will sit a computer. inside that computer will display the main slide <br> overlaying the slideshow will be the message " Press Enter to continue " the user could press a key on the physical keyboard or press the key on a virtual keyboard or tap on the computer screen. maybe the image could change depending on whether the user was a mobile user or not?

upon pressing start the user will be guided to the home page
