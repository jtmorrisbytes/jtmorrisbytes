so the components of my app will go a little bit like this:

I will have multiple pages in my app for different topics and kinds of content.

potential features:
1. It would be nice if the blog could be integrated with pushes to social media, so that when I publish a post, the server pushes the post to social media.
2. SEO is a big deal. I want people to be able to find me on the internet once I get myself out there. I want my app to be search indexable while out on the internet.
3. it would be nice if I could edit the blog and website in a point/click wordpress post manner. 
4. I want the website to use visual themes that represent my personality. I want to express myself in a show, don't tell manner.

~topic overview:

* I know for sure that I want a landing page to help capture your attention and briefly detail what this website is about
 - maybe list the top two most important projects and maybe one that I am most recently working on.
* an about page? maybe people might be interested in knowing more about me? maybe I could find a way for people to get to know me without having to go to a seperate page. I know for sure that i want people to know who i am by the thematic elements in the website. in essence, i want the website to be me.
* a place to talk about the things that i am doing (eg a blog). this place could be where I go into in-depth analasyses on the projects that i am working on. the article could include a video of the process and some images to help demonstrate the content. however, not everyone has the time to read an in depth analasis on a project, so that will lead into the next page i want to have in the website
* a projects page that will incorporate all the projects that I want to include in my website. I will potentially want to use this on the landing page as well. 
    - the idea could be to lead in the user to a picture of the project with a short phrase of what it is. bare minimum detail, no fluff or extras
    - if the user is interested in checking out more about the project, they can click on it to get more information about it. the primary detail should be at the top of the page with an option to read more ( like a button ) if the user is interested in reading more about it. this shouldnt go all in, maybe a brief history with a summary and some thoughts on the project and maybe a few things learned. at the end of the short summary could be a link to a blog page with more detail on the project.
    - if the user lands on the projects page, there could be a list of projects waiting for them to check out if they are interested. eventually I would want to sort or filter them if they get too large
    - I would eventually want to offer a way that the user could try out a project that I made if they want to see it. I think that would be a good experience. however, I dont want the user to have to download and install programs just to try it out??
